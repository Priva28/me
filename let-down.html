        <p>we are so unbearably disconnected from the world that surrounds us. time passes by, things happen outside of our control. you can’t help but feel like the world around you was crafted by the brilliant minds of others while you hang around, hysterical and useless. are you taking advantage of the life that was given to you? do you feel like you’ll never be enough to make your dent in the universe? what does it even mean to “change the world”, and why is it something we strive to do? is it out of love for humanity, or is it simply to leave a legacy we feel proud of? there’s a stark contrast between what we know our brain is capable of and how we actually wield that power, this can be extremely disturbing. these questions might have no answers, and you should learn to be okay with that. coming to this realization is like a breath of fresh air. the moment that you realize where you’re actually at, and that even though everything you see around you, everything you consume, everything you interact and create with may be the result of others work—it’s you that put yourself in this moment. every action, every word, every decision has led you here. there’s only one person you can thank for that. if you got yourself here, reading this, feeling these emotions.. keep going. you’re the main character, you choose where you go next—and you never know—you might change the world without even realizing.</p>
