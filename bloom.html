        <blockquote>“how do you take something completely natural, that will eventually transfer to the listener, but not just settle for that initial feeling. how do you go to an imaginary landscape instead?” - victoria legrand</blockquote>

        <p>throughout human history, we’ve looked up at the stars and defined constellations to support our beliefs, experiences, and mythology. different cultures found patterns to provide meaningful insights into who we are as people. it’s difficult to not look up to the sky and feel a sense of awe, how can things matter so deeply when we are so insignificant? there's something in us that longs to understand, to trace patterns through the mess, to search for meaning. it's what makes us human.</p>

        <p>listening to bloom is like stargazing, it’s meanings evolve with the listener. it doesn’t set out to be something specific, it’s confident in it’s abstractness—and that is why it's my favorite album of all time.</p>
